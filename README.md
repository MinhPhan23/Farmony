# Farmony

Explore the world, make new friends, listen to great music. All in this top down RPG game.

Follow your mom's last wish, collect the seeds around each map and bring the world to your sick father. In each map, interact with an NPC to know more about your mother's story (your choice affects the story) and get hints to finish your objectives. What is waiting for you at the end of your journey?

## Features

The original project was developed for a 7-day game jam. Music for the game was created during the following music jam. This project will keep being polished even after the jam.

## Run the game

The game was made using Processing. To run the game on your desktop, download the [Farmony](https://github.com/MinhPhan23/Farmony/tree/main/Farmony) folder. Open the Farmony.pde file using [Processing](https://processing.org/download) and run using the run button in the IDE.

The Window executable file is available and will be added soon.

Mac executable file will not be available until the Java OpenGl bug is fixed in future Processing releases.
